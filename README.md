# Tenting Stand for R Go Split Keyboard
A low profile stand that allows for varying the angle of the R-Go Split Keyboard.

The Tenting Stand is a fully 3D printed device that allows an R-Go Split Break Ergonomic Keyboard to be supported at 5 different tenting angles. A tenting angle can help reduce pronation of the forearm and improve ergonomics. Using this stand, the user can elevate their keyboard at a 0, 5, 10, 14, or 15-degree angle.

## Usage

The user can move the legs to whichever angle is best suited to them using the tabs protruding from the front. The stand will then lock into place. When finished, the user can lower the stand back to 0 degrees and leave each half separated, or push them back together.

## Required Skills

- 3D printing
- Pulling (for cable ties)
- Pinching (for assembling legs to clips)

## Required Components

- 4x - 4" cable ties (https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/home/storage/ties/58888-standard-cable-ties?item=03K7010)
